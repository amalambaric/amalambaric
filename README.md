### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Today, the internet welcomes us with beautiful and interesting websites that provide information, entertainment and help us in our work.

Have you ever wondered how the Internet began? What the very first website looked like and who invented it?

6 August 1991 - this date is considered the birthday of the first website at info.cern.ch. The site is still available today, with the same interface and content as 28 years ago.

Its founder is considered to be programmer Tim Berners Lee, who started the history of the World Wide Web. The site was developed together with the Belgian razabotnik Robert Caillot.

They created this resource while working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). The programmers simply wanted to put data on the web to simplify the work of their colleagues.
